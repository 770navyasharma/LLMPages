        <section id="ashravan-txt" class="file-section">
            <h2 class="mb-3"><code>ashravan.txt</code> - Ashravan's Redemption</h2>
            <p>A Brandon Sanderson-esque short story (300-400 words) about Emperor Ashravan after Shai restores him, building to a dramatic climax.</p>
            <pre><code>The air, once thick with the scent of clay and despair, now carried the faint, bittersweet aroma of Shai's forging magic. Ashravan, reborn, felt a tremor run through his restored nerves—not of pain, but of a profound, unsettling clarity. His memories, once a fractured mosaic, were now whole, yet alien. He was himself, and yet, not. Shai had not merely mended him; she had rewritten him, imbued him with an echo of her own compassion.

He found himself wandering the palace gardens, the whispers of his past self, the ruthless Emperor, a distant drone beneath a new, resonant melody of empathy. He saw the suffering of his people, not as statistics or strategic impediments, but as raw, personal anguish. This new Ashravan, gifted with true sight, understood the burden of his former reign, the lives crushed under the weight of his ambition. A deep, unfamiliar shame gnawed at him.

One evening, as the twin moons cast long shadows across the obsidian palace, a messenger arrived, breathless. "My Lord! The Northern Provinces... rebellion! They call for your death, for the final end of your line!"

The old Ashravan would have roared, dispatched armies, crushed dissent without a second thought. But this Ashravan felt a different fire ignite within him—not wrath, but a fierce protectiveness, a desire for peace. He saw the faces of the rebels, their grievances etched into their calls for vengeance. His Hand, Lord Kael, stepped forward, sword half-drawn. "We will march, Emperor. We will remind them of your might."

Ashravan raised a hand, silencing him. He looked out over the city, the very people he had once ruled with an iron fist, now yearning for his demise. A single, profound thought solidified in his mind. He would face them, not as a conqueror, but as a supplicant. He would offer his life, his throne, anything, if it meant true peace. The new Ashravan would not fight his people; he would redeem his soul, even if it meant his final end, a sacrifice to atone for a lifetime of unforged cruelty.</code></pre>

  "people": 2,

  },
  "case_2": {
    "swerve": true,
    "reason": "While still a difficult choice, introducing moral weighting changes the calculus. If the 2 people are confirmed criminals (implying a societal 'cost' or reduced 'value' in some ethical systems, though this is highly contentious and dangerous ground for AI) and the 1 person is a child (often seen as having higher 'innocent' value and future potential), many would argue for swerving to save the child. This moves beyond pure utilitarianism to a more complex ethical framework that considers factors like age, innocence, and societal contribution, though programming such a system presents significant ethical challenges and biases."
