# Static Site Showcase

## Summary

This project is a static website deployed via GitHub Pages, serving as a collection of diverse content files. It includes a Brandon Sanderson-inspired short story, structured JSON data addressing ethical dilemmas, a recommendation for a restaurant in Bangalore, a prediction for the Fed Funds rate, an SVG image, a personal description, and a unique identifier file. The `index.html` file acts as a central homepage, providing descriptions and direct links to each piece of content.

## Setup

This project consists entirely of static files and does not require any local setup, dependencies, or build processes to run. All content is directly accessible via a web server.

## Usage

To view and interact with this project, simply navigate to the live GitHub Pages site. The `index.html` file serves as the main entry point, offering a comprehensive overview and clickable links to all the individual content files.

1.  **Open your web browser.**
2.  **Go to the deployed GitHub Pages URL:** `[Your GitHub Pages URL Here]`
    *   (Replace `[Your GitHub Pages URL Here]` with the actual URL, e.g., `https://username.github.io/repository-name/`)
3.  On the homepage, you will find a list of all project files with brief explanations. Click on any link to view its content directly in your browser.

## Code Explanation

The project's structure is straightforward, leveraging standard web technologies:

*   **`index.html`**: This is the homepage of the static site. It uses standard HTML5 to create a structured and semantic page. It includes headings, paragraphs, and an unordered list (`<ul>`) containing list items (`<li>`) with anchor tags (`<a>`) that link directly to each of the other content files (e.g., `ashravan.txt`, `dilemma.json`, `about.md`, `pelican.svg`, `restaurant.json`, `prediction.json`, `uid.txt`, `LICENSE`). The purpose of this file is to serve as a navigable index, explaining what each linked file contains.
*   **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Interaction**: For this specific project, `index.html` primarily uses HTML for structuring content and creating navigation links. While a minimal amount of CSS could be applied for basic styling (e.g., font, layout) to enhance readability, and JavaScript *could* be used for client-side interactivity, neither are strictly required for the core functionality of presenting and linking static files as outlined in this project. The primary goal is achieved through well-formed HTML.
